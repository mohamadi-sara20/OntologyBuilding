# OntologyBuilding
Knowledge Engineering Course - Sharif University of Technology 


An ontology for vertebrates has first been designed.  
Two websites (https://a-z-animals.com and https://animalia.bio) that have structured information on animals and their features have been crawled. 
The crawled information has been used and mapped to populate the ontology with animal instances. 

It has been attempted to merge the information of the two websites by checking the scientific names of the animals, but that does not cover all the double instances. 

You can use protégé or any other software to draw inferences and query the ontology.
